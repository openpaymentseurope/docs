Svenska Handelsbanken do not support usage of IBAN for debtor account or for any payment product, BBAN must be used without clearing number. 

For domestic payments a BBAN without clearing number must be used for the creditor account as well while specifying the clearing number in its own field. Non-domestic payments require that you specify the phone number for the debtor. 

The payment flow requires that you call either “get payment status” or “get payment authorization” endpoints to finalize the payment after authorizing it with Mobilt BankID. 
This must be done within the lifetime of the access token generated by Mobilt BankID, this lifetime is not documented but are approximately 30 seconds.

Update PSU data for payment initiation requires that the PSU-ID header is sent in in the format of yyyyMMddNNNN for the authorisation process for a payment initiation when submitted.
