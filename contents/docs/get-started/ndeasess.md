For domestic payments, Nordea requires BBAN for debtor and IBAN for creditor. All currencies must be set to SEK.

Nordea does not support payment authorizations, this is wrapped by Open Payments Gateway.
Once the authentication process for a payment is completed, the payment is created and confirmed with Nordea. It might take up to several minutes before the payment gets the status ACSC, this is normal and caused by delays by Nordea.
