SCA is based on BankID which are an identification solution that allows companies, banks and governments agencies to authenticate and conclude agreements with individuals over the Internet. For more information on BankID: www.bankid.com. 

Swedbank has a redirect authentication flow. It is not possible to get an access token unless redirecting the user. Since Open Payments wrap this functionality after completing the consent flow (where we return a redirect url pointing to our identity server), 
and Swedbank requires an SCA for approving consents and payments, Open Payments redirect the user twice. 

First time for signing in and getting an access token, and the second time to approve the consent / payment. 

Swedbank Consent flow allows for the creation of a consent which does not require a list of accounts. This consent is valid immediately without requiring a consent authorization but is only valid for GetAccounts. It is meant to be used to create a second consent with a list of accounts.

In Open Payments gateway we wrap this functionality, meaning if a user creates a consent without providing a list of accounts, we first create a consent at the ASPSP which is valid for a one-time use and then call their GET accounts endpoint to get a list of accounts.

We then call the ASPSPs create consent endpoint again, but with the accounts fetched from the previous step.
